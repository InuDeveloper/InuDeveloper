## Who I am

Hi guys. I am David and I'm an indie software developer and Computer Science student from Dominican Republic. I work with JavaScript for my projects and use differents frameworks, for example. ASTRO, Next.JS, React.JS and others. I feel comfortable using any IDE but I prefer using Visual Studio Code as my main IDE.

## Projects I'm working on

I made projects for fun and code solutions to problems anybody have. I been working on a new project to solve Trello, ClickUp and others IT solutions problems. Another project I been working on is a private project called MERQA.
